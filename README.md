# LFG Zone POC

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Obtain npm/node if you don't have it. I'd suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
3. `npm install -g yarn` (unless you already have yarn)
4. `yarn install`
5. `yarn start` will start a parcel hot-reloading live dev server at http://localhost:1234

## Publishing to gh-pages
1. `yarn gh-pages`
2. No really, that's it.
